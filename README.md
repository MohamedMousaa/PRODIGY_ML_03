# Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The task was completed as part of an internship project, focusing on Task-03.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset. It consists of 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs in JPEG format. Each image is labeled as either a cat (0) or a dog (1). You can download the dataset from the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Implementation
The implementation involves the following steps:
- Data preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Model training: Implementing and training an SVM classifier using scikit-learn.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
